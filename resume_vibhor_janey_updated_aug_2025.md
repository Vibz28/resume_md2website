## WORK EXPERIENCE

**Bristol Myers Squibb**  
_**Senior Manager, AI Solution Architect, GPS Business Insights and Technology**_
*Jul 2025 – Present | New Brunswick, NJ*

- Delivering an **AI copilot and decision-support** experience targeting **5,000+** manufacturing and quality users. Architecting an **agentic orchestration layer** with a graph-based workflow engine, containerized for elastic deployment, leveraging data lake query engines over S3. Implementing **MCP tool declarations** to standardize capability exposure across agents and systems.
- Building pipelines to identify, document, and perform **RCA on deviations**, auto-generate **CAPA** drafts (HITL), and constructing **semantic knowledge bases** from historical deviation worklists and SOPs. Enabling **text-to-SQL** access to past deviations.
- Implementing an **LLM observability and tracing layer** for generation traceability, prompt versioning, and end-to-end visibility testing to support validation. Designing guardrails, RBAC, and audit trails aligned to GxP expectations.

_**Manager, Data Architecture, Global Product Development and Supply**_
*Jul 2023 – Jul 2025 | New Brunswick, NJ*

- Led information and data architecture for manufacturing, including a **Batch Genealogy** graph data product (BGDP) unifying **SAP, Oracle EBS, and CMO** sources, reducing data processing time by >40%. Architected and integrated 7 contract manufacturing organizations' genealogy from **CoA/CoC** documents into **BGDP**, enabling traceability.
- Integrated **BGDP** with **SAP Batch Release Hub** (Component Check) under the APMC program, improved release decision efficiency by >50%.
- Launched a **metadata cataloging** initiative for the manufacturing data lake, aligning business and technical metadata across 7+ source integrations.

**Formulatrix**  
_**Machine Learning Specialist**_
*Jun 2022 – Aug 2022 | Bedford, MA*

- Built a computer vision model to classify microplates for the FAST Liquid Handler, achieving 98.59% accuracy across datasets. Implemented in TensorFlow using **Classification-by-Retrieval (CbR)**
- Created an API configuration for image capture and curated labeled datasets under varied conditions. Tested inference on Raspberry Pi Zero & Coral Edge TPU.
- Conducted a salary analysis across multiple offices. Built a regression model in R to forecast increments and visualized results.

**Zebra Technologies**  
_**Software Engineer**_
*Oct 2019 – Jun 2021 | Kennesaw, GA*

- Led the front-end design team for a new product launch; redesigned UX in Figma/Adobe XD and implemented with React.
- Collaborated to deploy an anomaly detection model in Python combining a boxplot method with FBProphet.
- Contributed to the inception and design of a new banking branch management product.
