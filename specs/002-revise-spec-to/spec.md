# Feature Specification: Resume-based Experience Website Structure

**Feature Branch**: `002-revise-spec-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Revise spec to replace podcast episodes with resume-based Experience content. Page structure: Home, Experience, Projects, About. Use resume details (BMS roles in 2025/2023, Formulatrix 2022, Zebra 2019‚Äì2021) and projects from resume. Emphasize achievements and contact visibility."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
	‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
	‚Üí Identify: actors (site visitor, site owner), actions (browse, filter, contact), data (experience entries, projects, profile), constraints (resume-sourced content, four pages)
3. For each unclear aspect:
	‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
	‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
	‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
	‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
	‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
	‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- Mandatory sections completed
- Optional sections omitted when not relevant

### For AI Generation
1. Mark ambiguities with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
2. Do not guess unstated details
3. Make requirements testable
4. Typical gaps: user roles/permissions, performance targets, error behaviors, integrations

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a visitor, I want to quickly understand Vibhor Janey‚Äôs experience, key achievements, and projects, and have clear ways to contact or connect, so I can assess fit for collaboration or hiring.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a visitor lands on Home, When they scan the hero and highlights, Then they can navigate to Experience, Projects, or About in one click.
2. Given a visitor opens Experience, When they view roles (BMS 2025/2023, Formulatrix 2022, Zebra 2019‚Äì2021), Then they can read concise summaries and selected achievements for each role.
3. Given a visitor opens Projects, When they browse project cards, Then they see a title, brief description, and link (if available) for each project, including Cotton Pest Classification.
4. Given a visitor opens About, When they read the profile and skills, Then they see contact methods (email, LinkedIn) clearly and can click to initiate contact.
5. Given a visitor on any page, When they resize to mobile, Then all sections are legible, accessible, and navigable with consistent header/footer.

### Edge Cases
- If a project has no public link, it should still display title and description without broken links.
- If some roles have many achievements, show the first 3 by default (2 on small screens), with a Show more/Show less control to reveal up to 6 total.
- If contact methods are unavailable, About should not show empty placeholders.

## Requirements (mandatory)
