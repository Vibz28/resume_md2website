# Feature Specification: Modern Resume Website

**Feature Branch**: `001-modern-resume-website`  
**Created**: 2025-09-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Modern resume website from existing markdown resume (data scientist and AI engineer). Sleek standout design. Pages: landing page with one featured episode; episodes list page (20 episodes from local markdown data); about page; projects page. Episodes data pre-defined in a markdown file; no external feeds. Static site."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A visitor lands on the personal website of a Data Scientist & AI Engineer to quickly understand their expertise, explore highlighted content (a featured episode), browse a catalog of episodes, review background and skills on the About page, and examine notable Projects‚Äîall without friction, external accounts, or third-party data dependencies.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a visitor on the landing page, When they view the hero section, Then they see the person‚Äôs name, title (Data Scientist & AI Engineer), a concise value proposition, and a single featured episode with title, date, and a call-to-action to view the full episode detail.
2. Given a visitor navigates to the Episodes page, When the page loads, Then it lists exactly 20 episodes sourced from a predefined local markdown dataset, each with title, date, short summary, and a link to its detail.
3. Given a visitor opens an Episode detail from the list, When the content loads, Then they see the full episode content from local markdown and can navigate back to Episodes.
4. Given a visitor navigates to the About page, When the page loads, Then it displays biography, expertise areas, and contact methods derived from the existing resume markdown.
5. Given a visitor navigates to the Projects page, When the page loads, Then it lists notable projects with titles, brief descriptions, and links to more information or code repositories (if provided in the resume markdown).
6. Given the site is static, When the visitor browses any page, Then it loads without external API calls or dynamic server-side dependencies.
7. Given the Episodes page, When episodes are displayed, Then they are ordered by newest (most recent date) first, with ties broken deterministically.
8. Given some episodes or projects lack images, When the page renders, Then consistent placeholders are shown and layout remains intact.
9. Given the Contact section, When a visitor seeks contact options, Then only mailto/social/profile links are provided (no form submission).

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the featured episode is missing or malformed from the dataset? ‚Üí Fallback to a default featured episode (first valid entry) and display a non-blocking warning copy.
- How does the system handle episodes with missing fields (e.g., date or summary)? ‚Üí Render the page without the missing field and do not break layout; optional label "Details coming soon" for missing summaries.
- What if the episodes dataset contains fewer than 20 entries? ‚Üí Show all available episodes and display count; do not fail page load.
- What if images for an episode or project are missing? ‚Üí Use a generic placeholder thumbnail and accessible alt text.
- How does navigation behave when JS is disabled? ‚Üí All pages are directly navigable using plain links; content remains readable.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST present a landing page that includes personal identity (name, title) and a single featured episode with title, date, brief teaser, and a primary call-to-action.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST provide an Episodes page listing exactly 20 episode entries when the dataset includes ‚â•20 items; otherwise, list all available items and indicate the count.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST store episode data in a single predefined local markdown file (or a set of local markdown files) bundled with the site; no external feeds are used.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST provide an Episode detail view for each listed episode that renders full content from the local source.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide an About page summarizing background, expertise, and contact options using content from the existing resume markdown.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST provide a Projects page listing notable projects with a short description and optional links.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST offer consistent site-wide navigation to Landing, Episodes, About, and Projects pages.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST operate as a static site with no server-side runtime or external API dependencies.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST support basic accessibility: keyboard navigation, semantic landmarks, alt text for images, and visible focus states.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST load without blocking errors in the browser console on modern evergreen browsers.
- **FR-011**: The landing page MUST still render if the featured episode is absent; a sensible default featured entry is shown or the section gracefully degrades.
- **FR-012**: The Episodes list MUST handle missing fields gracefully without layout breakage.
- **FR-013**: The site MUST include legal and contact links (e.g., footer) if provided in the resume markdown; otherwise, omit.
- **FR-014**: Episode count and ordering MUST be deterministic (most recent first by date; ties broken by a stable rule such as slug).
- **FR-015**: The site MUST avoid any third-party trackers or analytics by default.
- **FR-016**: Episode thumbnails are OPTIONAL; when present, they MUST display consistently with a recommended 16:9 visual treatment; when absent, a neutral placeholder MUST be used.
- **FR-017**: The featured episode MAY include a hero image if provided; absence MUST NOT block rendering.
- **FR-018**: The Projects page MUST present a simple list (no interactive filters or tags).
- **FR-019**: The site MUST present a clean, modern aesthetic emphasizing readability and visual hierarchy with a neutral palette and a single accent color; typography should be consistent and professional.
- **FR-020**: Contact MUST be via links only (e.g., mailto/social profiles); no contact form is required.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Episode**: Title, date, summary/teaser, slug/identifier, full body content, optional image thumbnail, optional tags.
- **Project**: Title, brief description, optional link(s) (demo, repository), optional thumbnail.
- **Profile**: Name, role/title, overview/bio, skills/expertise highlights, contact links.
