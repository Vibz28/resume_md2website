# Feature Specification: Update Website Design to Align with Figma Designs

**Feature Branch**: `003-update-website-design`  
**Created**: 2025-09-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I am updating the website which converts markdown files to functioning resume websites to align with my Figma designs. The website's core functionality and page structure could change, as well as the overall CSS layout. The contents, however, will remain the same. I also need to maintain most of the core functionality I have already built out in the first version of the website which already exists in this folder. Only the design elements and page layout may change, the content structure will follow the old guidelines. Please read the README.md file for reference of what I have currently. The updated design files are included in the figma_design folder. Please read the previous specifications for reference of what has already been created."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
  ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
  ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
  ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
  ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
  ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
  ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
  ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
  ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- Mandatory sections: Must be completed for every feature
- Optional sections: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. Mark all ambiguities: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. Don't guess: If the prompt doesn't specify something, mark it
3. Think like a tester: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. Common underspecified areas:
  - User types and permissions
  - Data retention/deletion policies
  - Performance targets and scale
  - Error handling behaviors
  - Integration requirements
  - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a visitor, I want to view the resume site with an engaging design that reflects the Figma layouts so that I can quickly understand experience, projects, skills, publications, and how to contact the owner.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the home view loads, When the visitor scrolls, Then the site reveals sections in the order: Hero ‚Üí About ‚Üí Experience ‚Üí Projects ‚Üí Skills ‚Üí Publications ‚Üí Contact.
2. Given the navigation is visible, When the visitor selects a section name, Then the page moves to that section and highlights the active section in the navigation.
3. Given the Projects section is visible, When the visitor selects a category filter, Then only projects in that category are shown and the rest are hidden until the filter is cleared.
4. Given the Experience section is visible, When the user expands or views an entry, Then key achievements are visible for that role in a clearly readable list.
5. Given the visitor prefers dark mode, When they toggle the theme, Then the entire site switches themes and remains consistent while browsing.
6. Given the Contact section is visible, When the visitor uses the provided methods (links or form) to reach out, Then the appropriate action occurs (e.g., opens email client or validates form) with clear feedback.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when resume content for a section is missing or incomplete? The site should still render remaining sections with an inline notice or fallback text.
- How does the site behave on very small viewports (e.g., older phones) or ultra-wide displays? Sections must remain readable and navigable without layout breaks.
- How does the site handle users who prefer reduced motion? Animations should diminish or disable while preserving content visibility and clarity.
- What happens when there are many projects or publications? The site should remain performant and provide a way to scan content efficiently (e.g., filtering, condensed display). Decision: No pagination in v1; support up to 12 items per section without regressions. If more than 12 items exist, display a "Show more" control that reveals items in batches (e.g., +12) while keeping filters applied.
- How are external links (e.g., publications, code, demos) handled? They should open predictably and be clearly labeled to avoid confusion.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: The site MUST present all content from the existing resume data structure with no loss of information.
- FR-002: The site MUST align visually with the provided Figma designs for the following sections: Hero, About, Experience, Projects, Skills, Publications, Contact.
- FR-003: The site MUST support navigation that moves directly to each section and indicates which section is currently active.
- FR-004: The Projects area MUST provide category-based filtering that updates visible projects immediately.
- FR-005: The Experience area MUST display ‚ÄúKey Achievements‚Äù for each role in a clearly readable list.
- FR-006: The site MUST support a theme toggle between light and dark, and apply the choice consistently throughout the browsing session.
- FR-007: The site MUST remain usable and readable on mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
- FR-008: The site MUST respect user settings for reduced motion by minimizing or disabling non-essential motion effects.
- FR-009: The site MUST preserve the existing content structure (sections, fields, and semantics) to avoid changes to authoring workflows.
- FR-010: The site MUST remain compatible with the current static deployment approach.
- FR-011: Content rendering MUST degrade gracefully if some content fields are missing (e.g., display ‚ÄúNot provided‚Äù or hide that field with no layout break).
- FR-012: External links MUST be clearly indicated and behave predictably (e.g., open in a new context as appropriate).

Additional requirements (finalized):
- FR-013: The Contact section MUST include a client-side validated form and provide immediate user feedback. On submit, the system initiates the user's email client via a prefilled mailto link (subject/body) and confirms success visually; a direct email link is also available as an alternative.
- FR-014: The Publications area MUST provide category-based filtering (e.g., All, AI/ML, Privacy, Quantum, Healthcare) and default sorting by year (newest first).
- FR-015: URL deep-linking to selected filters or items is deferred for this release (out of scope for v1). The page state is not required to persist in the URL.

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)
- Resume Content: The collection of information authored by the site owner, including Experience (roles, durations, locations, achievements), Projects (titles, descriptions, categories, metrics, optional links), Skills (grouped capabilities), Publications (titles, venues, years, authors, optional links), and Contact info.
- Navigation: The set of section anchors and labels that enable users to move through the single-page experience, including an indication of the current section.
- Display Preferences: User-selected visual preferences like theme and reduced motion that influence how content is presented without altering the content itself.
