# Feature Specification: Update Website Design to Align with Figma Designs

## Overview

This feature migrates the current multi-page Next.js resume website to a modern single-page application (SPA) that aligns with the Figma design specifications. The migration will preserve all existing functionality for markdown resume parsing, content extraction, and testing frameworks while introducing modern UI components, smooth animations, and enhanced user experience.

## User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Resume Content Display

- **Goal:** Access comprehensive resume information in an engaging, modern interface
- **Context:** First-time visitor or returning user seeking current professional information
- **Steps:**
  1. Navigate to the website homepage
  2. Experience smooth hero section with animated introduction
  3. Scroll through sections (About, Experience, Projects, Skills, Publications, Contact) with smooth animations
  4. View detailed experience information with timeline visualization
  5. Filter and view projects by category
  6. Access contact information and social links
- **Expected Outcome:** Seamless single-page experience with all resume content accessible via smooth scrolling navigation

### Scenario 2: Content Management & Updates
- **User:** Site owner updating resume content
- **Goal:** Update resume information while maintaining design consistency
- **Context:** Regular updates to experience, projects, or skills
- **Steps:**
  1. Update markdown files in the existing structure
  2. Run build process to regenerate website
  3. Deploy updated content
- **Expected Outcome:** New content appears in the modern design with consistent styling and animations

### Scenario 3: Dark Mode Experience
- **User:** Visitor preferring dark mode interface
- **Goal:** Toggle between light and dark themes for optimal viewing
- **Context:** User preference or different lighting conditions
- **Steps:**
  1. Access theme toggle in navigation
  2. Switch between light/dark modes
  3. Browse all sections with consistent theming
- **Expected Outcome:** Smooth theme transitions with all components properly styled for chosen theme

## Functional Requirements

### Core Requirements
- **REQ-001:** Migrate from multi-page routing (`/experience`, `/about`, `/projects`) to single-page application with smooth scrolling sections
- **REQ-002:** Preserve existing markdown parsing functionality for resume content extraction
- **REQ-003:** Implement modern UI components using shadcn/ui library with consistent styling
- **REQ-004:** Add motion/react animations for enhanced user experience (scroll animations, hover effects, transitions)
- **REQ-005:** Implement responsive design supporting mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- **REQ-006:** Add dark/light theme toggle with system preference detection
- **REQ-007:** Maintain existing data models and content structure
- **REQ-008:** Preserve GitHub Pages deployment compatibility
- **REQ-009:** Implement smooth navigation between sections with highlight indicators
- **REQ-010:** Add interactive filtering for projects and skills sections

### Edge Cases
- **EDGE-001:** Handle missing or incomplete markdown content gracefully with fallback displays
- **EDGE-002:** Ensure animations perform well on low-performance devices with reduced motion preferences
- **EDGE-003:** Maintain accessibility standards for screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **EDGE-004:** Handle long content lists (projects, publications) with pagination or infinite scroll
- **EDGE-005:** Ensure proper fallback when JavaScript is disabled

## Key Entities

```

## Implementation Details

### Technical Approach
1. **Architecture Migration**: Convert from Next.js App Router pages to single-page component architecture
2. **Component Library Integration**: Implement shadcn/ui components for consistent design system
3. **Animation Framework**: Integrate motion/react for smooth animations and transitions
4. **Theme System**: Implement CSS variables-based theme system with dark/light mode support
5. **Content Preservation**: Maintain existing markdown parsing with enhanced presentation layer

### Architecture Changes
- **Replace page-based routing** with section-based single-page layout
- **Consolidate multiple pages** (`/experience`, `/about`, `/projects`, `/home`) into single App component with sections
- **Enhance navigation** from traditional links to smooth-scroll section navigation
- **Upgrade styling** from basic CSS to Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **Add state management** for theme, navigation, and filter states using React hooks
- **Implement responsive breakpoints** with mobile-first design approach

### Dependencies
- **motion/react**: Animation framework for smooth transitions and scroll-based animations
- **shadcn/ui**: Modern UI component library (Button, Card, Badge, Progress, etc.)
- **lucide-react**: Icon library for consistent iconography
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework with custom configuration
- **next-themes**: Theme management for dark/light mode switching
- **sonner**: Toast notification system for user feedback

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- **Theme Toggle Component**: Test light/dark mode switching functionality
- **Navigation Component**: Test smooth scroll to section functionality
- **Filter Components**: Test project and publication filtering logic
- **Content Parsing**: Test markdown content extraction maintains data integrity
- **Animation Components**: Test reduced motion preferences are respected

### Integration Tests
- **Section Navigation**: Test navigation between all sections works correctly
- **Content Loading**: Test all markdown content loads and displays properly
- **Responsive Behavior**: Test layout adapts correctly across breakpoints
- **Theme Persistence**: Test theme preference persists across page reloads
- **Filter Integration**: Test filtering works with navigation and URL state

### End-to-End Tests
- **Complete User Journey**: Test full navigation from hero to contact section
- **Content Accessibility**: Test all content is accessible via keyboard navigation
- **Mobile Experience**: Test touch interactions and mobile-specific features
- **Performance**: Test page load times and animation performance
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Test functionality across major browsers

## Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- **Page Load Time**: < 2 seconds for initial content visibility
- **Animation Performance**: 60 FPS for all animations on modern devices
- **Bundle Size**: < 500KB gzipped for main application bundle
- **Lighthouse Score**: > 95 for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO

### User Experience Metrics
- **Time to Interactive**: < 3 seconds on 3G network
- **Section Navigation**: < 1 second smooth scroll between sections
- **Theme Switch Time**: < 200ms for theme transition completion
- **Content Readability**: Meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards for color contrast

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **RISK-001:** Content parsing regression during migration - *Mitigation: Comprehensive testing of markdown extraction, preserve existing test suite*
- **RISK-002:** GitHub Pages deployment compatibility issues - *Mitigation: Test static export functionality, maintain .nojekyll file*
- **RISK-003:** Performance degradation from animations - *Mitigation: Implement reduced motion preferences, optimize animation performance*

### Medium Risk
- **RISK-004:** Mobile responsiveness issues with complex layouts - *Mitigation: Mobile-first design approach, extensive testing across devices*
- **RISK-005:** SEO impact from single-page architecture - *Mitigation: Proper meta tags, structured data, semantic HTML*
- **RISK-006:** Accessibility regression from new components - *Mitigation: Use shadcn/ui accessible components, comprehensive accessibility testing*

### Low Risk
- **RISK-007:** Theme system compatibility across browsers - *Mitigation: Progressive enhancement, CSS variable fallbacks*
- **RISK-008:** Animation interference with screen readers - *Mitigation: Proper ARIA labels, respect prefers-reduced-motion*
